The Ice-cream website was developed to provide a convenient and enjoyable online space for ice cream enthusiasts to browse and purchase their favorite treats. With a growing demand for online shopping, especially in the food and beverage industry, I wanted to create a platform that makes it easy for customers to explore different ice cream flavors, and access fun coupons through a user-friendly interface. The website aims to enhance the overall experience of buying ice cream by offering features like a cart, checkout process, and discount options, ensuring that customers have a smooth and hassle-free journey from browsing to ordering.

The Ice Cream Website is a user-friendly platform designed to provide customers with a delightful online experience. The website includes essential pages such as a Menu showcasing a variety of flavors, a Flavour Page where users can explore different ice cream options, and a Cart and Checkout Page to make purchasing easy and efficient. Additionally, thereâ€™s a Coupons Page for users to see different discount codes to use and promotions, and an About Us Page offering insight into the story behind the brand. This website is created to offer a seamless, enjoyable shopping experience for ice cream lovers of all ages.

## Design Process
------------------------------------------------------

This website is designed for ice cream enthusiasts of all ages who love exploring and purchasing a wide variety of ice cream flavors online. The target audience includes both children and adults, with a special focus on creating a fun and bubbly theme to attract younger audiences. I wanted to capture the nostalgic joy we all experienced as kids when indulging in ice cream, so I filled the homepage with vibrant, mouth-watering images to draw users in and entice them to make a purchase. To further enhance the experience, I incorporated playful animations, adding a touch of excitement and visual appeal, especially for children. I wanted to make the website just for children, but as I continued developing the website, I realized that ice cream is loved by everyone, regardless of age, and decided to make the site just as enjoyable for adults who appreciate a high-quality treat as well.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to browse different ice-cream flavours and also have the option to filter them.

## Technology
------------------------------------------------------
- **ChatGPT:** I used ChatGPT to help me with my design process and also asked for some ideas that I should implement in my website to make it more functional and appealing. I got those ideas and did some research on Google on how to implement them and then implemented them.

## Testing
------------------------------------------------------

### Social Media Page
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page in any section and try to submit an email address without the `@` and verify that a message shows up indicating an error in the input.

### Checkout Page
1. Go to the checkout page and try to submit insufficient digits in the credit card details and see if an error message shows up indicating an error in the input.
2. The same thing for incorrect expiry date input and CVV.

### Log In Page
1. Go to the Log in page and similarly try to input an email address without the `@` and verify that a message shows up indicating an error in the output.

### Responsiveness
In smaller screen sizes like phones, I added media query codes to help make it responsive and also added a few more things. For example, I added a hamburger menu which stores the navigation bar so it won't take up much space and is stored neatly. Also, in smaller screens, the data is now shown vertically in one column and is also smaller and neat.
