The Ice-cream website was developed to provide a convenient and enjoyable online space for ice cream enthusiasts to browse and purchase their favorite treats. With a growing demand for online shopping, especially in the food and beverage industry, I wanted to create a platform that makes it easy for customers to explore different ice cream flavors, and access fun coupons through a user-friendly interface. The website aims to enhance the overall experience of buying ice cream by offering features like a cart, checkout process, and discount options, ensuring that customers have a smooth and hassle-free journey from browsing to ordering.

The Ice Cream Website is a user-friendly platform designed to provide customers with a delightful online experience. The website includes essential pages such as a Menu showcasing a variety of flavors, a Flavour Page where users can explore different ice cream options, and a Cart and Checkout Page to make purchasing easy and efficient. Additionally, thereâ€™s a Coupons Page for users to see different discont codes to use and promotions, and an About Us Page offering insight into the story behind the brand. This website is created to offer a seamless, enjoyable shopping experience for ice cream lovers of all ages.

Design Process
------------------------------------------------------

This website is designed for ice cream enthusiasts of all ages who love exploring and purchasing a wide variety of ice cream flavors online. The target audience includes both children and adults, with a special focus on creating a fun and bubbly theme to attract younger audiences. I wanted to capture the nostalgic joy we all experienced as kids when indulging in ice cream, so I filled the homepage with vibrant, mouth-watering images to draw users in and entice them to make a purchase. To further enhance the experience, I incorporated playful animations, adding a touch of excitement and visual appeal, especially for children.I wanted to to make the website just for childrens but as I continued developing the website, I realized that ice cream is loved by everyone, regardless of age, and decided to make the site just as enjoyable for adults who appreciate a high-quality treat as well
